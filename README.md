# markup_json_to_db
Simple script to process the JSON output of Bluebeam's Studio Prime Markup Export command.

This was created more as a proof of concept but has ended up making it's way into production at my current employer.  We're transitioning towards using the Studio API to directly integrate with the markup data.  This transition will include proper implentation of an ORM (SQLAlchemy) as well as automatic update intervals and other time-saving features.

For more details/usage instructions/etc. send me a message.
